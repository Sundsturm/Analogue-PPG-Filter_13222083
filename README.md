# Analogue-PPG-Filter_13222083
A second-order analog bandpass filter, achieving a 0.1â€“10 Hz bandwidth for photoplethysmogram signal filtering.

This is a project regarding analogue circuit design and development, using polar capacitors, LM741CN, and some other hardware components. The circuit was built on top of breadboard and tested with laboratory equipments, such as oscilloscope, signal generators (or sinusoidal generator with Arduino), DC power supply, and digital multimeter.
